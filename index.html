      <h1> What if highschoolers wrote essays knowing someone would <span>actually <i>read</i> them?</span> </h1>
      <p>What if peer feedback taught the reader and writer at the same time while freeing up overworked teachers? What if universities could see a student’s whole body of work, not just their college essay? What if undergrads could fund their tuition through mentoring?</p>
      <p>We believe that good writers don’t become that way from writing alone. They improve by receiving feedback, and from giving it. That’s why we are creating Peerbased Review, a simple platform for students to share and engage in each other’s work.</p>

      <h1> Parents of highschool students pay <span class="yo">1.2B</span> to get tutoring for their kids. </h1>
      <p> At the Peerbased Review, we not only believe that the possibility of readership is essential to engaged, growing highschool writers, but we believe that the revision skills and peer interactions that accompany it lead to growth impossible writing only for teachers.

      <p>Charlie Argon is a third-year Ph.D student specializing in Chinese history. As a professor, he has seen firsthand how lack of readership discourages highschool writers from feeling as if there work is meaningful.</p>
      <p>His experience as a tutor provided the first indication that many parents are extremely willing to pay to improve their students shot at getting into a good university, but also gave him a hunch there may be a better way.</p>

      <p>Hi! I’m a software engineer with a non-traditional background who did not always do spectacularly well in the low-autonomy atmosphere of K-12. In college I thrived on newfound academic independence, ultimately discovering programming communities like the Recurse Center that convinced me how peer-driven learning is a missed opportunity for many academics, and possibly for the fabric of society, too.</p>
